# Write a program that prompts the user to enter the month and year, and displays the number
# of days in the month. For example, if the user entered month 2 and year 2000, the program
# should display that February 2000 has 29 days. If the user entered month 3 and year 2005,
# the program should display that March 2005 has 31 days.
